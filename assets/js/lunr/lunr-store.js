Shannon Tweezers ST42 is an accurate and intelligent LCR meter with a tiny body, which is convenient to distinguish those electronic components and measure their value. A best friend for your hobby and daily life. The new circuit and structural design make it the best electronic tool, as simple as tweezers and as precise as a bench meter.      üéµ Do you remember, the color code of the Resistor?   üéµ Do you remember, the direction of the Diode?   üéµ Do you still, tear down them to Measure?       üéµ It doesn‚Äôt matter, Leave all to Shannon TweezersÔºÅ      No matter the components are an SMD on board or through-hole package independent, Shannon Tweezers could distinguish them with Accurate test results.      Shannon Tweezers could measure Inductor, Capacitor, Resistor, Diode, LED, and any other discrete devices impedance characteristics.   Main Features  Rich features are easily Controlled by a 4-direction Type with Center-push Function Button.   Measure mode selections: AutoMode/L/C/R/Diode/LED and etc. Shannon Tweezers can distinguish DUT type automatically in AutoMode.      Low excitation voltage ensures the SMD components in-Circuits test. In-circuit test application, bias current introduces much error when the excitation voltage is higher than the forward voltage of diodes, that‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt get an accurate result by DMM. Shannon Tweezers can select a 0.1Vpp excitation signal for these applications.      Excitation signal frequency: 100/120/1k/10kHz. Multi-Frequency can support different types of components and high range DUT values.      Super accurate, 0.1% basic accuracy for resistors. Shannon Tweezers implement Pseudo Kelvin 4-wire architecture to achieve accurate measurements. Main-parameter and second parameter are all 4 digits.      High dynamic support milliohm to Megohm resistor Auto Identify L/C/R device type and Auto Frequency with Hold Function Novel mechanical design is stable for clamping 0402 components Compact design and Portable         Measurement Demonstration  0.1% standard Resistor test result. All of the test results are within 0.1% accuracy, the resistance value is from 10ohm to 1Mohm, even the excitation voltage is just 0.1Vpp.      5pF Standard Capacitor test result. 4fF peak to peak noise in a few seconds, more than 10 samples.      0402 SMD Capacitor Clamping. It‚Äôs easy to clamp a 0402 capacitor and lay it down.      Temperature Drift Test. When DUT is a 1kohm precision resistor, the temperature drift test result is 5ppm/‚ÑÉ.      Attention        Specifications      Design Concept  Shannon Tweezers ST42 uses the latest integration technology to achieve complex impedance measurement. While improving the integration level, ensures low noise, high stability, and easy calibration. In a limited space, a variety of rich functions, ultra-wide frequency range, ultra-large dynamic range, and other complex test modes are realized.   The ultra-low power design allows the product to be used for several hours at a time. In the sleep mode, the ultra-low quiescent current makes the storage time as long as several months.         The mechanical design of the product solves the traditional LCR tweezers‚Äô unstable clamping, large contact impedance, and inflexible keystrokes. The high-strength tweezer arms make the clamping very stable, and easily realize the clamping and measurement of 0402 devices. The gold-plated surface solves the problem of large contact impedance affecting accuracy.

        "excerpt":"We have always listen to customers feedback and made firmware upgrade as needed. For new features and bug fixes, follow this page to upgrade the firmware.   Note1: We provides a command line tool for now, please follow below instructions. Windows, linux, mac are supported, please use corresponding package.   Shannon Tweezers ST42 Firmware Upgrader Instruction Video    Firmware Uploader command line tool   Update on 2023/5 The ota server has changed its domain name, please use latest tool fw-update-2023-5-10.zip in below link.   The command line tool by default downloads the latest firmware from server and push it to device. Please make sure there is internet connectivity before running the tool.  Click to download   Upgrade to specific version   In rare cases, new bugs may bring to latest firmware. Though we‚Äôll fix them as soon as we find them, if your application is affected, you can always upgrade to previous version by add -v v1.5.0 parameter to the command line tool. Replace v1.5.0 with version number you want. Please check below section on details of every version upgrades.   Notice that when no version number specified, it always upgrades to latest version.   Firmware Changes   v1.5.4~1.5.7 2024/6   This series of upgrade includes small updates.     Fix abnormal waveform when measuring diode.   Fix items in menu. ‚Äòy‚Äô is displayed as ‚Äòu‚Äô, add missing 100Hz option, use ‚ÄòSEC.PARA‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòSECPARA‚Äô   Show serial or parallel symbol for L and C   v1.5.2~1.5.3 2023/5   This series of upgrade added some small improvements on user interface.      HOLD function is fixed, which is introduced by OL detection function.   Fix the dummy invalid voltage option in menu.   v1.5.1 2023/4/5   Overload detection is now available! When the impedance or DC resistance measured is large than a threshold, the UI now will show OVERLOAD instead of some garbage data.   v1.5.0 2023/4/3   Now you can press and hold joystick in measurement UI to power off the meter. It will beep before turning off and as soon as you release the joystick battery will be disconnected. As for timeout auto-power-off, in which case the meter is not used for a period of time, it will still show original 5 seconds count down UI. Press the joystick to cancel the countdown. If the timeout period is not suitable for you, simply change it in settings menu of system-&gt;timeout. Thanks ono on EEVBlog for proposing this optimization! A further optimization for OVERLOAD detection is coming for next revision. Enjoy it!   v1.4.3 2022/7/22   Thanks to TheDefPom‚Äôs accuracy review video, we fixed the resistor measurement noise bug in v1.4.2.   Please let us know if you encountered any issue with Shannon Tweezers, we definitely will improve it in short time.   The AUTO mode is also suitable discrete resistor measurement. In fact, AC excitation signal with builtin DFT analysis leads to better noise and accuracy performance since the DC offset in circuit is eliminated compared to DC signal measurement.   The DC resistance measurement is now enabled with builtin both 50Hz and 60Hz notch filter, so the noise introduced via long lead and large resistance can be reduced greatly.                  version       time       changes                       v1.6.0       2025/06/23       Keep auto hold settings unchanged during autoset                 v1.5.8       2024/12/10       Fix wrong diode direction in left hand mode.                 v1.5.7       2024/6/29       misc update to UI.                 v1.5.3       2022/7/24       remove dummy invalid voltage option in menu                 v1.5.2       2022/7/24       fix HOLD function introduced by overload detection                 v1.5.1       2022/7/24       add overload detection support                 v1.5.0       2022/7/24       support press and hold joystick method to power off tweezers                 v1.4.4       2022/7/24       fix DCR auto range may fail when shorted.                 v1.4.3       2022/7/21       Fix unstable DC resistance result.                 v1.4.2       2022/6/27       fix &gt;100mH level inductor measurement stuck issue, note: a short-calibration should be performed to fix this issue                 ¬†       ¬†       fix self-calibration may stuck                 ¬†       ¬†       added left/right button function to exit/enter menu                 ¬†       ¬†       added alarm for unaccepted button                 v1.3.9       2022/6/8       added low battery warnings.                 v1.3.8       2022/5/25       fix abnormal battery result when switching between LED and DIODE mode.                 v1.3.7       2022/5/15       show forward voltage when no diode detected in DIODE mode.                 ¬†       ¬†       allow to set auto-off timer to NEVER.                 v1.3.6       2022/5/14       fix auto-off timer in DCR and DIODE mode.
